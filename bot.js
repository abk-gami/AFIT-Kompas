// Sure, here is an example of how to create a React Native app that displays different screens in a bottom sheet when different buttons are pressed:


import React, { useState } from 'react';
import {
  Button,
  View,
  BottomSheet,
  Text,
} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [screenToShow, setScreenToShow] = useState(null);

  const buttons = [
    {
      title: 'Screen 1',
      component: Screen1,
    },
    {
      title: 'Screen 2',
      component: Screen2,
    },
    {
      title: 'Screen 3',
      component: Screen3,
    },
  ];

  const handleButtonPress = (button) => {
    setScreenToShow(button.component);
    setIsOpen(true);
  };

  const renderBottomSheet = () => {
    if (!screenToShow) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <BottomSheet
        isVisible={isOpen}
        onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}
      >
        <View>
          {screenToShow}
        </View>
      </BottomSheet>
    );
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {buttons.map((button, index) => (
        <Button
          key={index}
          title={button.title}
          onPress={handleButtonPress}
        />
      ))}
      {renderBottomSheet()}
    </View>
  );
};

const Screen1 = () => <Text>This is Screen 1</Text>;
const Screen2 = () => <Text>This is Screen 2</Text>;
const Screen3 = () => <Text>This is Screen 3</Text>;

export default App;


// In this example, we have an array of buttons, each of which represents a different screen. When a button is pressed, the `handleButtonPress` function is called, which sets the `screenToShow` state to the component that corresponds to the button that was pressed. The `renderBottomSheet` function then renders the bottom sheet, which contains the `screenToShow` component.

// This is just a basic example, and you can customize it to fit your needs. For example, you can add a title to the bottom sheet, or you can add a close button. You can also use a different library to create the bottom sheet, such as react-native-modal.

// I hope this helps!
