// Sure, here is a corrected code that you can use to create a bottom sheet that has three different screens that will open when three different buttons are clicked in React Native:

JavaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import {
  BottomSheet,
  Button,
  View,
  Text,
} from 'react-native';

const Screen1 = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is Screen 1</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const Screen2 = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is Screen 2</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const Screen3 = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is Screen 3</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const [currentScreen, setCurrentScreen] = useState(Screen1);

  const openBottomSheet = (screen) => {
    setCurrentScreen(screen);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button onPress={() => openBottomSheet(Screen1)}>
        Screen 1
      </Button>
      <Button onPress={() => openBottomSheet(Screen2)}>
        Screen 2
      </Button>
      <Button onPress={() => openBottomSheet(Screen3)}>
        Screen 3
      </Button>
      <BottomSheet
        initialScreen={currentScreen}
        onClose={() => setCurrentScreen(null)}
      >
        {currentScreen}
      </BottomSheet>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
// Use code with caution. Learn more
// This code fixes the error by initializing the currentScreen variable before it is used. It also creates a BottomSheet component that has an initialScreen prop that is set to the currentScreen variable. This ensures that the correct screen is displayed when the bottom sheet is opened.

// I hope this helps!
